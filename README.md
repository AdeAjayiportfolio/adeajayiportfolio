# üí´ About Me:
Hi, I‚Äôm Adebambo Ajayi, an aspiring Data Analyst with a human resources and administration background. My journey into data analytics began with my passion for problem-solving, process improvement, and uncovering insights that drive meaningful business decisions. <br><br>I am completing an intensive Digital Skills Bootcamp in Data with JustIT, where I have honed my SQL, Python, R, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel skills. Through various projects, I have developed expertise in data extraction, cleaning, visualisation, and reporting, turning raw data into actionable insights. <br>Previously, in my roles at River Island, Global Guardians Management, and the NHS, I leveraged data to enhance HR and administrative processes‚Äîstreamlining recruitment, improving compliance tracking, and optimizing reporting systems. My ability to analyse trends, build dashboards, and present data-driven solutions has helped organisations make more informed decisions. <br><br>What I Bring to the Table:<br>üîπ Data Analysis & Visualisation ‚Äì Strong command of Power BI, Tableau, Excel, SQL, and Python to create insightful reports.<br>üîπ Business Intelligence & Storytelling ‚Äì Turning data into meaningful narratives that drive strategy.<br>üîπ Problem-Solving & Process Improvement ‚Äì Applying analytics to optimise operations and decision-making.<br>üîπ HR & Business Analytics ‚Äì Leveraging my HR background to analyse workforce trends and engagement. <br><br>Beyond Data Analytics<br>Outside of work, I‚Äôm passionate about continuous learning and self-improvement.
